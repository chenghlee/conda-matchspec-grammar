# List of strings rejected by conda (25.7) as MatchSpecs that I would argue
# should NOT be errors.  Many of these are based on patterns found in conda's
# `tests/models/test_match_spec.py`.
#
# Here, "rejected" means attempting to construct a `MatchSpec` object with the
# string raises an exception; it does NOT necessarily imply that if the parse
# had been successful, the resulting `MatchSpec` object would be actually
# meaningful and/or useful.
